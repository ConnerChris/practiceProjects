					<div class="panel-body"><p>Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in what is now
								Smiljan, Croatia. He was one of five children which included siblings Dane,
								Angelina, Milka and Marica, in the family. Tesla's interest in electrical invention
								was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household
								appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father,
								Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed
								for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the
								sciences. After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the
								Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt); the Polytechnic Institute in
								Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague during the 1870s, Tesla moved
								to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange.
								It was while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to
								Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age
								28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.</p>

				<div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body"><p>In 1884 Tesla arrived the United States with little more
										than the clothes on his back and a letter of introduction to famed inventor and
										business mogul Thomas Edison, whose DC-based electrical works were fast
										becoming the standard in the country. Edison hired Tesla, and the two men were
										soon working tirelessly alongside each other, making improvements to Edison's
										inventions. However, several months later, the two parted ways due to a
										conflicting business-scientific relationship, attributed by historians to their
										incredibly different personalities: While Edison was a power figure who focused
										on marketing and financial success, Tesla was commercially out-of-tune and
										somewhat vulnerable.</p>

										<p>After parting ways with Edison, in 1885 Tesla received funding for the Tesla
										Electric Light Company and was tasked by his investors to develop improved
										arc lighting. After successfully doing so, however, Tesla was forced out of the
										venture and for a time had to work as a manual laborer in order to survive.
										His luck changed in 1887, when he was able to find interest in his AC electrical
										system and funding for his new Tesla Electric Company. Setting straight to
										work, by the end of the year, Tesla had successfully filed several patents for
										AC-based inventions.  </p>

										<p>Tesla's AC system eventually caught the attention of American engineer and
										business man George Westinghouse, who was seeking a solution to supplying
										the nation with long-distance power. Convinced that Tesla's inventions would
										help him achieve this, in 1888 he purchased his patents for $60,000 in cash
										and stock in the Westinghouse Corporation. As interest in an
										alternating-current system grew, Tesla and Westinghouse were put in direct
										competition with Thomas Edison, who was intent on selling his direct-current
										system to the nation. A negative-press campaign was soon waged by Edison,
										in an attempt to undermine interest in AC power. Tesla, for his part,
										continued in his work and would patent several more inventions during this
										period, including the "Tesla coil," which laid the foundation for wireless
										technologies and is still used in radio technology today.</p>

										<p>Unfortunately for Thomas Edison, the Westinghouse Corporation was chosen
										to supply the lighting at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago,
										and Tesla conducted demonstrations of his AC system there. Two years later,
										in 1895, Tesla designed what was among the first AC hydroelectric power
										plants in the United States, at Niagara Falls. The following year, it was used
										to power the city of Buffalo, New York, a feat that was highly publicized
										throughout the world. With its repeat successes and favorable press, the
										alternating-current system would quickly become the preeminent power
										system of the 20th century, and it has remained the worldwide standard
										ever since.</p>

										<p>In addition to his AC system and coil, throughout his career, Tesla discovered,
										designed and developed ideas for a number of other important
										inventions—most of which were officially patented by other
										inventors—including dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and
										the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar
										technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic
										field—the basis of most AC machinery.</p>

					<div class="panel-body"><p>Having become obsessed with the wireless
						transmission of energy, around 1900 Nikola set to work on his
						boldest project yet: to build a global, wireless communication
						system—to be transmitted through a large electrical tower—for
						sharing information and providing free electricity throughout the
						world. With funding from a group of investors that included financial
						giant J. P. Morgan, in 1901 Tesla began work on the project in
						earnest, designing and building a lab with a power plant and a
						massive transmission tower on a site on Long Island, New York,
						that became known as Wardenclyffe. However, when doubts arose
						among his investors about the plausibility of Tesla's system and his
						rival, Guglielmo Marconi—with the financial support of Andrew
						Carnegie and Thomas Edison—continued to make great advances
						with his own radio technologies, Tesla had no choice but to abandon
						the project. The Wardenclyffe staff was laid off in 1906 and by 1915
						the site had fallen into foreclosure. Two years later Tesla declared
						bankruptcy and the tower was dismantled and sold for scrap to help
						pay the debts he had accrued.</p>

				</div>

				<div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body"><p>After suffering a nervous breakdown, Tesla
						eventually returned to work, primarily as a consultant. But as time
						went on, his ideas became progressively more outlandish and
						impractical. He also grew increasingly eccentric, devoting much
						of his time to the care of wild pigeons in New York City's parks. He
						even drew the attention of the FBI with his talk of building a
						powerful "death beam," which had received some interest from the
						Soviet Union during World World II. </p>
						<p>Poor and reclusive, Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, at the
						age of 86, in New York City, where he had lived for nearly 60
						years. But the legacy of the work he left behind him lives on to
						this day.</p>
						<p>Several books and films have highlighted Tesla's life and famous
						works, including Nikola Tesla, The Genius Who Lit the World, a
						documentary produced by the Tesla Memorial Society and the
						Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Serbia; and The Secret of
						Nikola Tesla, which stars Orson Welles as J. P. Morgan). And in
						the 2006 Christopher Nolan film The Prestige, Tesla was
						portrayed by rock star/actor David Bowie. In 1994, a street sign
						identifying "Nikola Tesla Corner" was installed near the site of his
						former New York City laboratory, at the intersection of 40th Street
						and 6th Avenue. </p>
